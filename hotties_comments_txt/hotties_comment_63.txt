Extreme envy to the lucky bastard that ringed or will ring that.
Is it just me, or does a heavily armed, beautiful woman just make anyone else feel safe and happy?

Libtards see guns and feel panic. I see them in the hands of a woman like this and think there would be no safer place to be than near her.
Love your guns...and your beauty as well, Patriot!
Gorgeous. Just gorgeous.
